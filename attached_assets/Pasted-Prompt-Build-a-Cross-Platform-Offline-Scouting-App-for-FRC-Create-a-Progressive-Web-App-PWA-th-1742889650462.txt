Prompt: Build a Cross-Platform Offline Scouting App for FRC

Create a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works on both mobile and desktop, fully offline, and is installable on any device (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac). It should be optimized for use during FRC competitions by multiple scouts.

Core Requirements:

1. Platform
	•	Must be a Progressive Web App (PWA)
	•	Fully installable and usable offline
	•	Runs on mobile phones and computers
	•	No backend server required
	•	Use IndexedDB or localStorage to store data locally

⸻

2. Match Scouting Form

Scouts can input data for a match using a form with:
	•	Team (select from a fixed list — see below)
	•	Tournament stage (Qualifications, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals)
	•	Match number
	•	Alliance color (Red / Blue)
	•	Fields with optional 1–7 rating and text:
	•	Defense performance
	•	Avoiding defense
	•	Scoring algae
	•	Scoring corals
	•	Autonomous
	•	Driving skill
	•	Climbing (dropdown: None / Low / High)

3. View Team Data
	•	When a team is selected:
	•	Show all previous match entries
	•	Display average ratings per category
	•	Show all comments
	•	Include graphs/charts to visualize performance

4. Export/Import & Sync
	•	Allow exporting local data to JSON or CSV
	•	Allow importing JSON files from other devices
